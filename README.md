## Welcome to my GitHub profile, have a look around!

I'm Rumil, and currently I am a graduate student pursuing my Master's in Applied Statistics and Data Analytics. As someone whose found the intersection of statistics, technology and health, and the recognition of patterns fascinating, I enjoy digging into interesting data sets and producing meaningful and data-driven insights using statistical and machine learning methods. As an undergraduate student I focused mainly on public health research creating data driven health programs and curriculums with the guidance of professors. Seeing these comprehensive projects come to life and creating a positive impact within different populations helped sparked my interest in the science of dataâ€” otherwise known as data science.

Since then I've commited myself to being an expert Data Scientist and Analyst by strengthening and dmeonstrating my statistical background as well as my programming abilities through some of my own projects. The application of these statistical learning techniques from industry to industry such as health, technology, real estate, and business have allowed me to see the power and leverage that data can truly provide. 

In my spare time I enjoy using data to help guide my training program as a powerlifter, reading philosophy or self-help books, playing basketball/video games, and just recently blogging on [medium](https://rumil.medium.com/).
